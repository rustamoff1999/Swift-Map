# Swift Map(_ :) Function Implementing

## Introduction
### Using the _map()_ Function with Collections
The _map()_ function loops over every item in a **_collection_**, and applies an operation to each element in the collection. It returns a collection of resulting items, to which the operation was applied.
### Using the _map()_ Function with Optionals
The _map()_ method of **_optionals_** allows you to transform the optional if it has a value, or do nothing if it is empty. This makes for shorter and more expressive code than doing a regular unwrap, and doesn’t require you to change your data type.  
You could use the _map()_ method to transform it **_safely_**, without having to check and unwrap it – if it were **_nil_**, the _map()_ call would do nothing.
## About My Implementation
Here is my own **_Swift map() Function Implementation_**, that can be used with both **_Collection Type_** and **_Optional_**.  
In this project I used _extensions_ for _Collection Type_ and _Optional Type_ for creating _myMap()_ function in there, which is the analogue of "official" _map()_ function. _myMap()_ is declared as _Generic_. 
You can see some examples in my code if something remains unclear to you.
